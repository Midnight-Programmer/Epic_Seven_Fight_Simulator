# Epic_Seven_Fight_Simulator
A Battle Simulator for the turn based game Epic Seven

This is mostly meant as a placeholder for now, but is something I would like to eventually work on when I have more time.

The idea is to create a simulator for the phone game Epic Seven, where I can select a team of heroes and input their stats through a simple GUI.
From there, I can have it run through the game's combat logic to determine success rates when fighting specific bosses that I've implemented.

This would require a lot of development, as I would need to implement the combat logic for whatever heroes and bosses I intend to simulate, 
which is a lot of upfront work. I know the various formulas used by the game to determine damage and turn order, but will need to find the time to actually sit down
and properly build out the core combat logic, as well as some initial heroes and a boss to test things with.
